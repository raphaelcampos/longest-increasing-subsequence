# Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

This code was developed as part of the course ***Design and Analysis of Algorithms*** of the Graduate Program in Computer Science of the Federal University of Minas Gerais.

## Algorithms
The implmented algorithms are the followings:
- g_lis: Greedy algorithm to calculate LIS based on pacience sort method
- bf_lis: Brute force algorithm to calculate LIS
- dp_lis: Dynamic programming algorithm to calculate LIS
